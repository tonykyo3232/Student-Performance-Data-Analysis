Idea of models for machine learning:
* model 1: predict grade based on Groups of races
* model 2: predict grade based on parental level of education
* model 3: predict grade based on lunch condition
* model 4: predict grade based on test preparation course.
* model 5: predict grade based on gender

#### Goals: being able to predict that under what condition will maximize studentsâ€™ performance on the exams.
Progress: 

* Using KNN to analyze the dataset based on the 5 models.
* Using Decision Tree Classifier to analyze the dataset based on the 5 models.
* Using VotingClassifier which contains these classifiers: KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, to analyze the dataset based on the 5 models.
